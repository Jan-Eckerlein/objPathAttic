# obj-path-attic

obj-path-attic is a work-in-progress utility for handling deeply nested object paths in JavaScript and TypeScript. It currently supports setting values on objects using a combination of dot and bracket notation. This library aims to provide a flexible and type-safe alternative to existing packages like object-path.

⚠️ This library is not production-ready yet. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- Set nested properties: Add or update deeply nested properties in objects with dot and bracket notation.

- Flexible handling of object and array paths: Supports mixed dot and bracket notation for accessing arrays and objects.
